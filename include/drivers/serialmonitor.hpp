    * @brief Class Serial Monitor
    * 
    * It aims to decode the messages received from the other device and redirectionate to other functions the content of message. 
    * For decode it has a predefined structure with a header (key) part and a content part. The key has to be four character, the content is defined by user.
    * The message received has to start with the '#' special character, the responses have the same key and start with "@" character. The special characters 
    * notice the direction of the message. Examples of messages:
    * 
    *   "#KEY1:MESSAGECONTENT;;\r\n"
    * 
    *   "@KEY1:RESPONSECONTANT;;\r\n"
    * 
    * The key differs for each functionalities, so for each callback function.
